# BUGS
- Gallery cannot be opened because of a Loading Loop

- Credits cannot be viewed because of a Loading Loop (Chapter 9 and 10)

# HOW TO (TEMPORARILY) FIX
1. Once you reach the Credits Scene in Chapter 9, close the game, rename the "aa" folder in your patch and complete Chapter 9.

2. Once you finished Chapter 9, rename the folder back and you can start playing Chapter 10.

3. Do the same once you reach the credits in Chapter 10.
