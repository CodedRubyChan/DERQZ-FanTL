Where are you!?
Where did you go!?
Stop hiding and come out!

[message name=Asuka Zelin charaid=600401 voice=06_012_0020]
Oh! You followed me! So, should we continue our talk?
Of course, it's about him.
I mean, I'll talk about it whether you want it or not.

[message name=Asuka Zelin charaid=600401 voice=06_012_0030]
Him, right, Arata Mizunashi.
Lately, he's been talking non-stop about you, and it's exhausting.
Like how he's excited to see how much you'll grow, and how you'll develop.

Arata Mizunashi...
Is he... your boyfriend!?

Well, we call each other Arata-kun and Rin-chan, so what?
Are you jealous? Do you think it's outrageous?
Well, good luck. Maybe you'll find someone someday too.

[message name=Asuka Zelin charaid=600401 voice=06_012_0060]
So, you see, to make him pay more attention to me,
I have to try my best, right?
Surprisingly, I'm pretty serious about that stuff.

[message name=Asuka Zelin charaid=600401 voice=06_012_0070]
That's why I decided to take over this Aphesis cult's headquarters.
Oh, and yes, he did ask me to do it, too...

[message name=Asuka Zelin charaid=600401 voice=06_012_0080]
I mean, this cult is just incompetent, isn't it?
They're all hyped about reincarnating to the uppermost world, but it's pointless.
With Iris' technology, there's no way to make that "setting" happen.
[/message]

[message name=Asuka Zelin charaid=600401 voice=06_012_0090]
Why don't they understand that?
Or maybe they do, and they're just saying it.
Even though it's impossible, they hint at hope to gather followers.

I can't stand to watch them play these childish games...
I'm in the process of managing things properly, turning them into
the uppermost world's obedient "slaves"â€”pure and well-brainwashed.

[message name=Asuka Zelin charaid=600401 voice=06_012_0110]
And, of course,
Sayaka!!
You are the prime target...!

I'm not dumb enough to believe your self-serving words!
You're just getting in the way of Liliana and the others!

...Tch.
She disappeared without a trace.
